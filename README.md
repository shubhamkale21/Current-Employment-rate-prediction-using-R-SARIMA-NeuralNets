# Current-Employment-rate-prediction-using-R-SARIMA-NeuralNets
This is cool series to forecast because it is a very hot topic right now, given the state of the job market and since we have been practicing ARIMA, SARIMA ,and even contingency models on unemployment, my team would like to examine those who are and have been gainfully employed in the past year during the COVID-19 crisis.â€‹ By looking at rates of gainful employment we can confirm whether the job market is truly as bad as it has been projected to be or if there are other factors that may be contributing to steady employment.
